# Hello.Angular.World
Hello Angular World (from Visual Studio and Local IIS) is a start-up project in which two worlds collide. 
This Visual Studio 2015 project is an exploration of how Angular 2 and ASP.NET can coexist. 
I have kept it as a simple "Hello World" application as it is an extract from My.iTunes solution which I will publish soon.
